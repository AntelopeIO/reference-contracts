The system resource CPU provides processing power to blockchain accounts. The amount of CPU an account has is measured in microseconds and it is referred to as `cpu bandwidth` on the `cleos get account` command output. The `cpu bandwidth` represents the amount of processing time an account has at its disposal when actions sent to its contract are executed by the blockchain. When a transaction is executed by the blockchain it consumes CPU and NET, therefore sufficient CPU must be staked in order for transactions to complete.
