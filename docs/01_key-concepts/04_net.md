content_title: NET as system resource
---

NET, as CPU and RAM, is a very important system resource in the EOS blockchain. NET is measured by the byte size of the transactions saved in the blockchain database and it is referred to as `net bandwidth` on the `dune -- cleos get account` command output. When a transaction is executed by the blockchain it consumes CPU and NET, therefore sufficient NET must be allocated to the account in order for transactions to complete.

For more details about resource allocation on the EOS blockchain refer to the [Resource Allocation](./05_system_resource_allocation.md) documentation.
