## Goal

Stake resources for your account to participate in the on-chain voting and governance.

## Before you begin

* Install the currently supported version of cleos

* Ensure the reference system contracts from `eos-system-contracts` repository is deployed and used to manage system resources

* Understand the following:
  * What is an account
  * What is network bandwidth
  * What is CPU bandwidth

## Steps

Stake 10 EOS network bandwidth for `alice`

```shell
cleos system delegatebw alice alice "0 EOS" "10 EOS"
```

Stake 10 EOS CPU bandwidth for `alice`:

```shell
cleos system delegatebw alice alice "10 EOS" "0 EOS"
```
